# Sales Data Parser & Refactoring Project

This project demonstrates my progress in Python programming, focusing on data manipulation, string parsing, and transition from procedural to clean, functional code.

## 🚀 Purpose
The main goal was to process a raw, "messy" data string containing sales records and transform it into a structured, readable report.

## 📁 Project Structure
* `legacy_parser.py`: Initial implementation. It focuses on basic algorithmic logic and manual string manipulation (handling delimiters like `;`, `,`, and `&`).
* `sales_parser.py`: Refactored, production-ready version. 

## 🛠 Key Improvements in Refactored Version
* **Robustness**: Added error handling and data validation to prevent crashes on malformed input.
* **Modern Python Practices**: Used **Type Hinting** and **List Comprehensions** for better readability.
* **Data Structures**: Replaced complex nested loops with efficient dictionary mapping for counting sold items.
* **OOP Mindset**: The code is organized into modular functions, making it easier to maintain and test.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Tools**: PyCharm, Git
